## Introduction

This project is a collaboration between the AI and the web dev promotions of BeCode. The objective of this one is to give you the opportunity to improve your learning of PHP (web dev) || making an API (AI) by solving a real life need: create an app for the real estate agency named ImmoEliza. 

Whereas HTML is good to create the visual interface of the form, you will need a backend script to actually process the data and compose the result via an API to be sent to the client.

## The Mission
The AI developers will create an API for the needed of this application.The web developers will develop an interface for the client "ImmoEliza". The main process is about a collaboration between the AI and the web dev, you all have to sync both in order to know how to construct the form. The result of the request must return a house in 3D view.

### The project must have at least:
- A clear & simply UX Design
- A logo
- A color matching (eg: not a blue text on a red background ;) )
- A form

## Technologies required
- HTML
- CSS
- BOOTSTRAP 
- PHP

## Learning Objectives 
Thanks to this project, you can learn the following :

- Backend: A basic but real-life form processing: sanitization > validation > execution > feedback
- Backend: create a function that displays all error messages above the form
- Backend: learn how to use an API using PHP
- Git: useful Readme file
- Server : deployment on Heroku
